# Using Docker to deploy a data science environment

This repository contains our setup and configuration files for setting up a data science environment for the students at NYU/Stern. (Jupyter running Python and R, plus MySQL).

## Instructions for students

* As the simplest, and default option for NYU/Stern students, we offer a JupyterHub server (on top of Kubernetes), which is connected to the NYU/Stern LDAP server. [Setup Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A5Y53eqBRRlrVMV-yLrpA9-3xZ3jQmv9i6qhOU5gn44/edit?usp=sharing).

We also a few more options for students (or classes) that want more flexibility:

* [Setup a Jupyter server and MySQL locally, using Docker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d9bRGYUSvTGRAqXIJAmH8_SGkXaU5bJ3w3p4IeXgQpo/edit?usp=sharing)

* [Setup a Jupyter server and MySQL on Google Cloud, using Docker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VpMxGQEBI19tcBmtCldQVqUrzWZAj_LvLF2os0R5IOY/edit?usp=sharing)

* [Setup a Jupyter server and MySQL on Amazon Cloud, using Docker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L7knUOpEimeYzpkuMoh_Qx8oyoPehFEsK-9rj6_j7vg/edit?usp=sharing)
